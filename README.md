## Local development with Bun

1. Run `bun install` to populate dependencies and create `bun.lockb`.
2. Use `bun run dev` for a Hot Module Reload dev server.
3. Run `bun run build` before deploying to make sure the production build compiles.
4. Use `bun run lint` to validate the repository with ESLint.
5. Start a production server locally with `bun run start` if needed.

# Began building this in v0
